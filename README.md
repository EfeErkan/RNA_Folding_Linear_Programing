# RNA_Folding_Linear_Programing

In living organisms, Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is an important matter that
has essential roles. RNA molecules play an active role in different processes
such as encoding and decoding. Subsequently, RNA molecules fold them-
selves to fit inside cells and perform specific functions in order to achieve
these processes. Accordingly, finding the secondary structure by using pri-
mary structure helps to determine the function of RNA. Further, RNA is
said to be highly important for diagnostic and therapeutic design. Hence,
it can be said that the findings of RNA studies could provide a better un-
derstanding to develop treatments for RNA-related diseases 1. Within this
perspective, RNA folding studies aim to clarify the relationship among se-
quence, tridimensional structure, and biological function 2. In particular, the
purpose of RNA folding problem is to predict the secondary structure of an
RNA molecule while only its nucleotide sequence is known.

In this project, we solve RNA Folding Problems with Integer Programming
using Gurobe
